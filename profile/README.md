Welcome to the Poulin Lab GitHub! This organization contains all the relavant code in relation to JF Poulin's research (read more here: https://poulin.lab.mcgill.ca/research.html).

For lab members: If you are a complete GitHub beginner, it is recommended to read [Poulin Lab GitHub Master Doc](Poulin_Lab_GitHub_Master_Doc.pdf) first!

## Repository Organization
- **By Project (recommended):** Each project has its own repository.
- **By Student:** Each student has their own repository (similar to Teams).

---

## Adding Code
- Navigate to the appropriate repository for your project or personal folder.
- Add your files using GitHub Desktop or directly on GitHub.
- Write a **clear commit message** describing your changes (e.g., “Added preprocessing script for dataset X”).
- Make sure your code follows any lab conventions and is commented for clarity.

--

## Sharing Code
- **Only administrators and owners** can share code with anyone outside of the organization.
- Regular members can share code between other lab members.
- All members of the organization already have access to private repositories, so you **do not need to add lab members as collaborators**.
- If using GitHub for development: share your work with lab members by creating a pull request or merging changes into the main branch.

--

## Editing Code
- Always pull the latest changes before starting work.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Comment your code so others can understand it.

---

## Asking for Help
- If you get stuck with GitHub, the Master Doc is your first reference.
- You can also create an issue in the repo if you’re unsure about something, always ask!
