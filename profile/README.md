Welcome to the Poulin Lab GitHub! This organization contains all the relavant code in relation to JF Poulin's research (read more here: https://poulin.lab.mcgill.ca/research.html).
For lab members: If you are a complete GitHub beginner, it is recommended to read [Poulin Lab GitHub Master Doc](Poulin_Lab_GitHub_Master_Doc.pdf) first!

## Repository Organization
- **By Project (recommended):** Each project has its own repository.
- **By Student:** Each student has their own repository (similar to Teams).

---

## Adding / Editing Code
- Always pull the latest changes before starting work.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Comment your code so others can understand it.
- Avoid uploading large raw datasets; use shared drives if needed.

---

## Asking for Help
- If you get stuck with GitHub, the Master Doc is your first reference.
- You can also create an issue in the repo if you’re unsure about something, always ask!
